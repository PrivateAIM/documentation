# Python SDK core
## Startup
Every FLAME analysis starts by connecting itself to the other components of the flame platform and starting an Analysis REST-API. 
All of this is done simply by instancing a FlameSDK object.
    
```python
from flame import FlameSDK
def main():
    flame = FlameCoreSDK()
    # Your code here
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```
The connection to the other components of the flame platform is established automatically when the FlameSDK object is created.

[//]: TODO (Add example for successful startup (i.e. automatic prints)


## Message Broker Client

### Purpose
The Message Broker is a service for sending and receiving messages between nodes. 
It used for simple communication between nodes for control and small data exchange purposes. 
Note that Volume Data, such as ML models, should be exchanged using the Result Service.
The maximum size of messages sent is around 2 MBs.

### List of available methods

#### Send message
```python
send_message(self, receivers: list[nodeID], message_category: str, message: dict, max_attempts: int = 1, timeout: Optional[int] = None, attempt_timeout: int = 10) -> tuple[list[nodeID], list[nodeID]]
```
Sends a message to all specified nodes.
* returns a tuple with the lists of nodes that acknowledged the message (1st element) and the list that did not acknowledge (2nd element)
* awaits acknowledgment responses within timeout
* if timeout is set, the timeout for each attempt in max_attempts is set to timeout/max_attempts, else if timeout is set to None, the timeout for each attempt is set to attempt_timeout (with the exception of the last attempt which will indefinite)

```python
# Example usage
# Send result to Hub Mino ID aggregator
self.flame.send_message(receivers=[aggregator_id],
                        message_category='intermediate_results',
                        message={'result': data_submission['id']})
```
#### Await and return responses

```python
await_messages(self, senders: List[nodeID],  message_category: str, message_id: Optional[str] = None, timeout: int = None) -> dict[nodeID, Optional[List[Message]]]
```
Halts process until responses with specified message_category (and optionally with specified message_id) from all specified nodes arrive and return their message objects. 
* if the timeout is hit or all responses are received, list successful responses and return None for those that failed
* sets the returned responses' status to “read”

```python
# Example usage
# Check for latest aggregated result
self.flame.await_messages(senders=[aggregator_id],
                          message_category='aggregated_results',
                          timeout=300)[aggregator_id][-1].body['result']
```

#### Get messages

```python
get_messages(self, status: Literal['unread', 'read'] = 'unread') -> List[Message]
```
Returns a list of all messages with the specified un-/read status.

```python
# Example usage
# Get read messages
self.flame.get_messages(status='read')
```

#### Delete messages by id(s)

```python
delete_messages(self, message_ids: List[str]) -> int
```
Delete messages with the specified message ids.
* returns the number of deleted messages

```python
# Example usage
# Delete message_a and message_b
self.flame.delete_messages(message_ids=[message_a_id, message_b_id])
```

#### Clear messages

```python
clear_messages(self, status: Literal["read", "unread", "all"] = "read", min_age: Optional[int] = None) -> int
```
Large-scale deletes messages based on the given un-/read status.
* returns the number of deleted messages
* if status is set to 'all', messages will be deleted regardless of un-/read status
* if specified with a min_age only messages older than the value in seconds will be deleted, else all of them will

```python
# Example usage
# Clear all read messages
self.flame.clear_messages(status='read', min_age=None)
```

#### Send message and wait for responses

```python
send_message_and_wait_for_responses(self, receivers: list[nodeID], message_category: str, message: dict, max_attempts: int = 1, timeout: Optional[int] = None, attempt_timeout: int = 10) -> dict[nodeID, Optional[list[Message]]]
```
Send message to specified receivers and halt process until a message from all receivers has been returned.\
*Combines functions `send_message` and `await_messages`.
* returns a dictionary with receiver node ids as keys and lists of their possible response messages as values
* awaits acknowledgment and message responses within the timeout, if set to None is allowed to run indefinitely
* response message has to have the same message_category as the message sent in order to trigger this

```python
# Example usage
# Send intermediate and await and return aggregated results
self.flame.send_message_and_wait_for_responses(receivers=[aggregator_id],
                                               message_category='intermedaite_results',
                                               message={'result': data_submission['id']},
                                               timeout=None)[aggregator_id][-1].body['result']
```



## Storage Client

### Purpose
The Storage Service is a service for saving and exchanging results between nodes of one analysis and locally between 
different analyzes of the same Project.

### List of available methods

#### Submit final result

```python
submit_final_result(self, result: Any, output_type: Literal['str', 'bytes', 'pickle'] = 'str') -> dict[str, str]
```
Submits the final result to the hub, making it available for analysts to download.
* this method is only available for nodes for which the method `get_role(self)` returns "aggregator”
* specifying the output_type changes the result's format to either a binary ('bytes'), text ('str'), or pickle file ('pickle)
* returns a brief dictionary response upon success

```python
# Example usage
# Submit aggregated results as text file
self.flame.submit_final_result(result=aggregated_res, output_type='str')
```

#### Save intermediate data

```python
save_intermediate_data(self, location: Literal["local", "global"], data: Any) -> dict[str, str]
```
Saves intermediate results/data either on the hub (location="global"), or locally.
* returns a dictionary response containing the success state, the url to the submission location, and the id of the saved data's storage.
  * utilizing the id, allows for retrieval of the saved data (see '*#Get intermediate data*')
    * only possible for the node that saved the data if saved locally
    * for all nodes participating in the same analysis if saved globally

```python
# Example usage
# Save data globally and retrieve storage id
self.flame.save_intermediate_data(location="global", data=aggregated_res)['id']
```

#### Get intermediate data

```python
get_intermediate_data(self, location: Literal["local", "global"], id: str) -> Any
```
Returns the local/global intermediate data with the specified id.
* only possible for the node that saved the data, if done locally
* for all nodes participating in the same analysis if saved globally

```python
# Example usage
# Retrieve globally saved data
self.flame.get_intermediate_data(location='global', id=data_storage_id)
```

#### Send intermediate data

```python
send_intermediate_data(self, receivers: list[nodeID], data: Any, message_category: str = "intermediate_data", max_attempts: int = 1, timeout: Optional[int] = None, attempt_timeout: int = 10) -> tuple[list[nodeID], list[nodeID]]
```
Sends intermediate data to specified receivers using the Result Service and Message Broker.\
*Combines functions `save_intermediate_data('global')` and `send_message`.
* returns a tuple with the lists of nodes that acknowledged the message (1st element) and the list that did not acknowledge (2nd element)
* awaits acknowledgment responses within timeout

```python
# Example usage
# Send intermediate data to partner nodes
successful, failed = self.flame.send_intermediate_data(["node1", "node2", "node3"], data)
```

#### Await intermediate data

```python
await_intermediate_data(self, senders: list[nodeID], message_category: str = "intermediate_data", timeout: Optional[int] = None) -> dict[str, Any]
```
Waits for messages containing intermediate data ids from specified senders and retrieves the data.\
*Combines functions `await_messages` and `get_intermediate_data('global')`.
* returns dictionary using the senders' nodeIDs as keys and the respectively retrieved data as values

```python
# Example usage
# Send intermediate data to partner nodes
self.flame.data = await_intermediate_data(["node1", "node2"], timeout=60)
```

* else all available FHIR data is directly appended to the returned list (discouraged as this will likely create lots of unnecessary overflow)
