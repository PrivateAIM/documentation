# Administrator Guide

## Introduction
This guide is addressed at realm/node administrators. By contacting the developer team an
initial realm will be assigned to the administrator.

The administrator will have full permissions for their realm acting as the base for all future
endeavours related to their organization for FLAME. Be it creating other realms, user accounts,
roles, or setting up nodes for the analysis execution.
The administrator will oversee all of those actions within their realm.
