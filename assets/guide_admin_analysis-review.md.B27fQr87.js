Before a valid train is built, it requires approval. Here, you may review the analysis code and see whether your provided node data will be used according to the study protocol. If it is, approve the train. If it is not, you may reject the train, effectively blocking its execution on your site. If you do so, we encourage you to inform the data analyst of the reason so they can revise it.
