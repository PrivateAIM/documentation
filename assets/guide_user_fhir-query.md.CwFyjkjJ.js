It allows healthcare systems to share data efficiently and securely. FHIR uses standard data formats and elements (known as “resources”) to represent clinical concepts, which can be accessed through RESTful APIs.</p><h2 id="mii-core-dataset" tabindex="-1">MII Core Dataset <a class="header-anchor" href="#mii-core-dataset" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;MII Core Dataset&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The MII (Medical Informatics Initiative) core dataset is a standardized dataset developed in Germany to improve the interoperability of health data across institutions. It includes essential health information, such as demographics, diagnoses, and treatments, ensuring consistent data use in healthcare and research. This dataset is aligned with FHIR standards, allowing for seamless data integration and exchange across different systems.</p><h2 id="application-in-flame" tabindex="-1">Application in FLAME <a class="header-anchor" href="#application-in-flame" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Application in FLAME&quot;">​</a></h2><p>In the FLAME platform, FHIR queries enable users to extract specific data from the MII core dataset, leveraging the standardized structure to conduct analyses across multiple nodes while maintaining data security and privacy. This is crucial for distributed learning and research in healthcare, allowing for the aggregation of data without compromising sensitive information.</p><h3 id="example-fhir-query" tabindex="-1">Example FHIR Query <a class="header-anchor" href="#example-fhir-query" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Example FHIR Query&quot;">​</a></h3><p>In the example provided, the queries are designed to count patients based on specific conditions and birthdates.</p><pre><code>•	Patient?birthdate=ge1990-01-01&amp;_has:Condition:subject:code=73595000
