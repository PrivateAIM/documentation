Focusing on secure distributed analysis of medical data, PrivateAIM brings together expertise from various German university hospitals and partners to address the critical need for privacy-enhanced technologies in medical research. By leveraging state-of-the-art privacy-preserving methods, PrivateAIM enables collaborative data analysis while ensuring the confidentiality of sensitive medical information. Through this project, researchers and healthcare professionals gain access to a powerful platform that not only facilitates distributed learning but also upholds the highest standards of data privacy and security. With its innovative approach, PrivateAIM is poised to drive significant advancements in medical research and ultimately improve patient care outcomes.</p><h2 id="mission-statement" tabindex="-1">Mission Statement <a class="header-anchor" href="#mission-statement" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Mission Statement&quot;">​</a></h2><p>At PrivateAIM, our platform FLAME (Federated Learning and Analysis in Medicine) is rooted in our team&#39;s rich expertise and experience, which bring together the best components from existing distributed learning platforms to create innovative new software solutions. Drawing from experiences in established platforms, we merge the most compelling features and functionalities to build a next-generation platform for secure distributed medical data analysis. This fusion of proven technologies enables us to deliver a robust and versatile solution that addresses the evolving needs of healthcare research and data analysis. Furthermore, our alignment with the Medical Informatics Initiative (MII) and <a href="https://www.medizininformatik-initiative.de/de/konsortien/datenintegrationszentren" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">DIC</a> standards underscores our dedication to interoperability and data exchange within the healthcare ecosystem. By leveraging the strengths of existing platforms and integrating them into our platform, we facilitate FLAME&#39;s seamless integration with existing healthcare infrastructure and ensure compliance with industry best practices. We provide users with an intuitive experience while driving progress in medical research and data privacy.</p><h2 id="security" tabindex="-1">Security <a class="header-anchor" href="#security" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Security&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="security-protocol" tabindex="-1">Security Protocol <a class="header-anchor" href="#security-protocol" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Security Protocol&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The following (WIP) flow chart depicts the security protocol used for protecting participating nodes against malicious code, as well as encrypting any stored results using envelope encryption.
